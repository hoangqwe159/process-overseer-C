# process-overseer-C
Two programs are required: a server program “overseer” and a client program “controller”, networked via BSD sockets (as covered in week 7). The
overseer runs indefinitely, processing commands sent by controller clients. The
controller only runs for an instant at a time; it is executed with varying arguments to issue commands to the overseer, then terminates.
The usage of the overeseer is shown below.
overseer <port>
The usage of the controller is shown below.
controller <address> <port> {[-o out_file] [-log log_file] [-t seconds]
<file> [arg...] | mem [pid] | memkill <percent>}
• < > angle brackets indicate required arguments.
• [ ] brackets indicate optional arguments.
• ... ellipses indicate an arbitrary quantity of arguments.
• { } braces indicate required, mutually exclusive options, separated by
pipes |. That is, one and only one of the following must be chosen:
– [-o out_file] [-log log_file] [-t seconds] <file> [arg...]
– mem [pid]
– memkill <percent>
